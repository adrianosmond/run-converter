# Run Converter

A tool I made for myself to quickly convert between pace per kilometre (which I use) and pace per mile (which is used by lots of British runners I know) so that I could know what they're talking about. I also wanted a thing to try Vue.js on.

It only uses touch events, so if you want to use it on a desktop you might need to turn on device emulation.

I tried to add a kinetic feel to the way the times change, so if you swipe quickly it will keep moving after you let go, gradually slowing down to a stop.
